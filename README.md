# Course Adviser
For the capstone project of INFS3605, Course Adviser was developed to provide students with on-demand insights into their degree progression at UNSW in an effort to automate and streamline the process of planning and selecting courses. Course Adviser is an online tool available on both the web and Android mobile platform that combines the UNSW handbook, timetabling unit and progression check into a complete comprehensive and integrated solution as a refresh in the poor user interface design and inefficient and confusing navigation flows experienced by UNSW Students to align with the UNSW 2025 strategy of providing a world class environment for students. Features such as the ability to review and rate courses have also been incorporated into Course Adviser to accelerate the collection of feedback and enable UNSW to improve the quality of its educational programs and therefore reach its target on academic excellence.
